# M2_Simple-Traffic-Light-System

## Introduction
Due to increase in demand of personal car or vehicles, the number of vehicles on the roads are exponentially increasing. Which gives rise traffic congestion and many road accidents and hazards. Traffic without adequate guidance can lead to traffic congestions and accidents.
Traffic Lights or Traffic Signals are signalling devices that are used to control the flow of traffic. Generally, they are positioned at junctions, intersections, ‘X’ roads, pedestrian crossings etc. and alternate the priority of who has to wait and who has to go
This is a simple project that helps to controll the traffic signals and make flow of traffic go smoothly.
## Features
Simple, low-cost, and real time traffic signal system that aims to overcome many problems and improves the traffic system.This system is based on ATMEGA 328.
